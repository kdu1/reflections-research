This paper introduces a Python package called pastamarkers that is compatible with matplotlib that involves markers that are pasta-shaped in order to help with visualizing astrophysical data. The authors reproduced famous notable plots using this system in order to show its usefulness. Astrophysical datasets are usually very complex, containing large amounts of data, making data visualization a useful tool. Currently, there is a lack of a set of markers tailored to the field. These markers can enhance the ability to interpret data. In pastamarkers, otherwise known as Promoting Astrophysical Studies Through
Aliments (PASTA) markers, there are 34 markers, each named after a type of pasta. These markers serve as a way to potentially make the takeaways from visualizations clearer to the general public. Some examples were shown utilizing the markers and different colors, with notable features including how the markers were spaced and how close together they were. They did so with the color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
of the globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272), and, against a gray backdrop of all stars, only selected markers for those fitting certain parameters in order to better visualize the evolutionary stages of the stars. A future goal is pairing pasta markers with their ideal colors to increase clarity further.
