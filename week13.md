This paper explores a scalable web based geo visualization platform for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Data Analysis. GIS involves systems that allow you to envision geographic data in the form of maps. The application, after recieving GIS data, is able to integrate and analyze the data and creating a map based visualization based off of it. The platform is able to analyze factors such as social networking activity, mobility patterns, route mapping and resource consumption. Datasets can be supplied, and are stored in MongoDB, with the backend built using Node.js. The visualization has a single page architechure as has three main layers: The data layer, the data parser module, and the visualization layer. This app is not bounded to a certain method of creating a visualization. There are various map customization options that allow the user to choose how they display their map. Adding markers, drawing map polygons respective to data, and adding areas to the map with selected colors are methods of displaying data. The feature of connecting to twitter to collect data is included, and involves two types of rendering: static data, which is used like any other source of data, and streaming data, which is collected in real time. Other users are allowed to add data to maps, which allows for crowdsourcing of map creation and for increased interactivity and usefulness of providing information.
