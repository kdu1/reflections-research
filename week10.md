This paper explores the use of virtual reality for data visualization using software and relatively inexpensive hardware. This paper provides VR as a solution for visualizing patterns in big data and that provides collaboration opportunities. First, preliminary inquiries were conducted using off the shelf virtual worlds, experimenting with ways to represent data in multiple data. As VWâ€™s have limitations in terms of representing data and scripting capabilities, the authors began development of a data visualization tool called iViz using Unity3D. iViz includes features such as using a standard web browser as a display, a broadcasting feature which allows multiple users to have a shared view following one user, and allowing the user to easily shuffle which attributes are associated with which XYZ axes for ease of revealing new patterns. Then, a controlled study was conducted which involved an immersive simulation of a Martian landscape in order to see if this method of visualization was more intuitive. Scientists involved in Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory missions were recruited and given a map-drawing task to complete utilizing a map editor designed and implemented by the authors. One group of scientists viewed the VR simulation, while another group viewed only panorama images on computers. This experiment has had ambiguously positive results for the VR group so far and is still in progress. Overall, this paper provides a preliminary exploration into the potential of VR in data visualization.
